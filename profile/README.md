As a seasoned developer with over a decade of experience, I have a strong foundation in various programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and C#. My journey began with web development, crafting responsive applications with frameworks such as React and Angular. Currently, I am deeply engrossed in the world of backend solutions, utilizing Node.js and Express to build robust APIs that power dynamic web applications.

I thrive in agile environments where collaboration and continuous integration are second nature. My approach is heavily inspired by Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Agile methodologies, enabling me to deliver high-quality code consistently. Also, I am passionate about cloud technologies and have garnered experience working with AWS and Azure to deploy scalable solutions.

I enjoy exploring new technologies and have recently taken an interest in machine learning. Leveraging TensorFlow and scikit-learn, I aim to integrate intelligent algorithms into existing applications. When not coding, you’ll find me contributing to open-source projects and honing my skills through various coding challenges.

Here's a glimpse of my pinned repositories that showcase my work:

- [Project 1: Task Manager API](https://github.com/ingvargustaf524/task-manager-api) - A fully functioning RESTful API to manage tasks, built with Node.js and Express. 
- [Project 2: E-commerce Website](https://github.com/ingvargustaf524/e-commerce) - A complete e-commerce solution utilizing React for the frontend and Django for the backend.
- [Project 3: Personal Portfolio](https://github.com/ingvargustaf524/personal-portfolio) - My personal portfolio website built with Gatsby.js, showcasing my projects and skills.

I believe in continuous learning and is always looking for new challenges. Let’s connect and collaborate on exciting projects!
